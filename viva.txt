KDD (Knowledge Discovery in Databases) in data mining refers to the process of extracting valuable insights, patterns, and knowledge from large datasets.
 Data abstraction is the process of hiding unwanted and irrelevant details from the end user. It helps to store information in such a way that the end user can access data which is necessary, the user will not be able to see what data is stored or how it is stored in a database
 An Abstract Data Type (ADT) is a conceptual model that defines a set of operations and behaviours for a data type, without specifying how these operations are implemented or how data is organized in memory.
 OLAP (Online Analytical Processing) is a technology that allows users to quickly analyze large volumes of data from multiple perspectives by storing it in a multidimensional structure, often called a "cube," enabling fast, interactive querying and reporting to extract business insights from complex datasets;
 Online transaction processing (OLTP) is a method of data processing that manages and stores large numbers of transactions in real time
 In a database management system (DBMS), "partitioning" refers to the process of dividing a large table into smaller, more manageable sections called "partitions," allowing for separate storage and access of data subsets,
 A database is a structured collection of data that is stored electronically and organized for efficient access and management. Databases can store any type of data, including numbers, words, images, videos, and files


Here are the answers to all your questions in a clear and concise manner:

---

### *1. What is Classification and Clustering?*
- *Classification:* It is a supervised learning technique that assigns data points to predefined categories or classes based on training data (e.g., spam vs. not spam emails).  
- *Clustering:* It is an unsupervised learning technique that groups data into clusters based on similarity without predefined labels.

---

### *2. K-Means Algorithm*
- *K-Means* is a clustering algorithm that divides data into K clusters by iteratively minimizing the distance between cluster centroids and the data points.  
*Steps:*  
   1. Initialize K centroids randomly.  
   2. Assign points to the nearest centroid.  
   3. Update centroids as the mean of the points in each cluster.  
   4. Repeat until centroids do not change significantly.

### *3. Association Rules*
- Association rules are used to identify relationships or patterns in large datasets (e.g., Market Basket Analysis).  
- *Example:* If a customer buys bread, they are likely to buy butter.  
- *Metrics Used:* Support, Confidence, Lift.

---

### *4. K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) Algorithm*
- KNN is a supervised learning algorithm used for classification and regression.  
- *Steps:*  
   1. Choose the K nearest neighbors based on distance (e.g., Euclidean distance).  
   2. Use majority voting (for classification) or average value (for regression).  

---

### *5. Naive Bayes*
- A probabilistic classification algorithm based on Bayes' Theorem.  
- *Assumption:* Features are conditionally independent.  
- Used in spam detection, text classification, etc.

---

### *6. Decision Tree*
- A decision tree is a tree-like model used for classification and regression.  
- *Terms in Decision Tree:*  
   - *Root Node:* The topmost node.  
   - *Decision Nodes:* Internal nodes where decisions are made.  
   - *Leaf Nodes:* Final output nodes.  
   - *Splitting:* Dividing a node into sub-nodes.  
   - *Pruning:* Removing branches to reduce overfitting.

### *7. Hierarchical Clustering (Agglomerative and Divisive Clustering)*
- *Agglomerative:* A bottom-up approach where each data point starts as a cluster, and clusters are merged iteratively.  
- *Divisive:* A top-down approach where all points start in one cluster, and the cluster is split iteratively.
